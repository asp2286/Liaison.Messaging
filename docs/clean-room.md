# Clean-Room Policy

## Policy

- This project must remain a clean-room implementation.
- No contributor may copy source code or non-public architecture from proprietary systems.
- Public documentation, standards, and common messaging patterns are acceptable reference points.

## Naming and Structure

- Avoid recreating internal naming and package structure from private codebases.
- Prefer generic, broadly understood terminology.

## Review Enforcement

- Reviewers may block or request rewrites for contributions that appear too similar to non-public sources.
- Maintainers may request design notes to explain origin of complex implementations.

## Reporting Concerns

- Open a `clean-room` issue with evidence and context.
- Maintainers will triage quickly and may temporarily revert questionable code until clarified.
