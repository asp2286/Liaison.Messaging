# Contribution Rules

## Clean-Room Requirement

- Do not copy code, naming schemes, or structural patterns from proprietary/internal repositories.
- Prefer generic, public terminology for APIs and internal structure.
- If any contribution appears too close to non-public sources, maintainers may require a rewrite.

## Originality

- All submissions must be original work authored by the contributor.
- Third-party snippets are allowed only when license-compatible and properly attributed.

## Reporting Concerns

- Open an issue labeled `clean-room` if you suspect similarity to proprietary material.
- Provide concrete references and context so maintainers can review quickly.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Update docs when public behavior, APIs, or project direction changes.
- Avoid mixed refactors and feature work in the same PR.
